| Day | Stars | Comment |
|---|:-:|-|
| [1: Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) | ⭐⭐ | Sum Calories by elf, find max elf.  Add sorting to find sum of top 3 elves. |
| [2: Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) | ⭐⭐ | Circular buffer for game logic |
| [3: Rucksack Reorganization](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) | ⭐⭐ | Find dups, then find dups in groups |
| [4: Camp Cleanup](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4) | ⭐⭐ | Parsing input data _could have been done_ in about 10 minutes in VS Code.  Took more than 1 hour in code.  :( |
| [5: Supply Stacks](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5) | ⭐⭐ | Parsing two types of data was a pain, took much more time than algo did.  Crates section of input had to be transposed so _columns_ were vectors of crates instead of rows.  Used pop/push for part 1. Used temporary storage and vec.append() for part 2.  Didn't visualize.  :( |
| [6: Tuning Trouble](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6) | ⭐⭐ | Protocol-aware puzzle -- write start-of-packet marker detection routine |
| [7: No Space Left On Device](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7) | ⭐⭐ | Terminal output parsing for directory structure/navigation.  Tried/failed to use Trees crate.  Tracked directory sizes in HashMap with full path as key. |
| [8: Treetop Tree House](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8) | ⭐⭐ | Simple elevation gradient algos in 4 directions |
| [9: Rope Bridge](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9) | ⭐⭐ | Weird rope knot dynamics -- tried/failed to visualize with animation via CrossTerm::Cursor::MoveTo.  :( |
| [10: Cathode-Ray Tube](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10) | ⭐⭐ | *Very* simple ALU with 2 op codes. Part 2 prints pixels for the human to read. |
