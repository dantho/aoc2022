| [1: Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) | ⭐⭐ |  |
| [2: Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) | ⭐⭐ | Circular buffer for game logic |
| [3: Rucksack Reorganization](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) | ⭐⭐ |  |
| [4: Camp Cleanup](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4) | ⭐⭐ | Parsing input data _could have been done_ in about 10 minutes in VS Code.  Took more than 1 hour in code.  :( |
| [5: Supply Stacks](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5) | ⭐⭐ | Parsing two types of data was a pain, took much more time than algo did.  Crates section of input had to be transposed so _columns_ were vectors of crates instead of rows.  Used pop/push for part 1. Used temporary storage and vec.append() for part 2.  Didn't visualize.  :( |
| [6: Tuning Trouble](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6) | ⭐⭐ | Protocol-aware puzzle -- write start-of-packet marker detection routine |
| [7: No Space Left On Device](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7) |  | Terminal output parsing for directory structure/navigation.  Used Tree crate. |
